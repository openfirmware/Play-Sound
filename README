About

Play Sound is an Automator action that simply tries to play any sound file passed into it.

It will accept a list of files, and only play audio files of types AIFF, M4A, MPEG (MP3), WAV, and ULAW. I may add support for more formats in the future, I wasnâ€™t sure how it would handle trying to play a non-audio file.

Installation by Source

Use git to clone a copy of the repo, then build it with XCode. Open the build product to auto-install it to your Automator library (~/Library/Automator). If you want to share it with all the users on your Mac, copy it to /Library/Automator instead.
