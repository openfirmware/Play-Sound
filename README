About

Play Sound is an Automator action that simply tries to play any sound file 
passed into it.

It will accept a list of files, and play each QuickTime-compatible file in 
order.

Installation by Source

Use git to clone a copy of the repo, then build it with XCode. Open the build 
product to auto-install it to your Automator library (~/Library/Automator). If 
you want to share it with all the users on your Mac, copy it to 
/Library/Automator instead.
